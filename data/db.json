      "body": "Why do we use it?\n i am learning this.Seeing Dan's career and personal life drowning due to his devotion towards Shiuli, her mother Vidya decides to make him go and take care of himself. Dan joins another hotel in Kullu as manager but is unable to take his mind off Shiuli. Soon he learns of Shiuli's failing health and visits the hospital. He apologises for leaving her abruptly and promises to stay with her. Seeing Dan, Shiuli calms and begins to improve again. She is soon discharged from the hospital and is brought home where Dan continues taking care of her. He takes her to a park and asks her why she remembered him before her fall. Shiuli responds by trying to say his name aloud. The following night Shiuli suffers a seizure and dies as her lungs collapsed. Emotionally broken, Dan visits Shiuli's home and comforts her despaired family. Several months later, Dan is rehired by the hotel where he completes his diploma and works as a sous chef.One day, he notices several missed calls and visits Vidya. They sit in the backyard discussing Shiuli. Pointing at the shiuli plant in the backyard, Vidya tells Dan that she was named Shiuli because of her fondness for the shiuli flower, which she loved collecting as a child. She explains him how just like a shiuli flower that lives all night and dies by dawn, her daughter too was short-lived. Vidya tells Dan about her family shifting to their hometown Trichy. She doesn't wish to leave Shiuli's plant, but Dan assures her that he would take care of it.As the story ends, Shiuli's family has moved and Dan carries the shiuli plant with him, as a symbol of the unconditional and unconventional love which had blossomed in his heart for Shiuli.
